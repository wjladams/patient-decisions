# Patient Decisions Application

This tablet based application aims to aid patient's make informed decisions about crucial health care choices.

* [Thyroid-Prototype](html/thyroid-prototype/demographics.html) The prototype for Thyroid Cancer.
* [Otosclerosis-Prototype](otosclerosis/demographics.html) The prototype for Otosclerosis.
* [storyboard](storyboard): The storyboard for the application, and extra details around any specific workflows that come up

## Participants in this research project

* Dr. Bill Adams <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/wjladams ">on LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://github.com/wjladams">on Github</a>: performed the following roles
  * Main developer of the web applications for the Thyroid Cancer and Otosclerosis use case.
  * Mathematician who designed and developed the new AHP theoretic calculations required.
  * Guided the design of the AHP models that power the decision for both the Thyroid Cancer and Otosclerosis models.
  * Setup and maintains the github source code repository.
* Charles Casper <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/casperone"> on LinkedIn</a> was the [REDCap](https://www.project-redcap.org/) developer for the Thyroid Cancer application, he:
  * Converted the existing prototype to REDCap
  * Worked in conjunction with Bill Adams, he created the AHP calculation framework in REDCap
  * Created the conditional walk through workflows and HTML screens in REDCap
* Bo Wang [on Github](https://github.com/wboboston), contributed as a research associate in the project.  He is a:
  * Research Fellow in Harvard Medical University, Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary, USA
  * Department of Thyroid and Parathyroid Surgery, Fujian Medical University Union Hospitalï¼ŒChina
* Dr. Natalie Justicz was the researcher who started this project for Thyroid Cancer applications:
  * She [developed the original prototype](https://justicz.github.io/natalie-presentation/)
  * She designed the AHP model in conjunction with Bill Adams
  * She designed the original workflow of the information walk through, in conjunction with Bill Adams and David Rodriguez.
* David Rodriguez [on Github](https://github.com/davidkrodriguez) was the lead Designer on both the Thyroid Cancer and Otosclerosis applications:
  * Designed the pairwise comparison screen
  * Designed the css and bootstrap code
  * Helped Dr. Justicz layout the steps of the patient walk through for Thyroid Cancer
  * Contributed greatly to the simplification of the presentation of the material
