# For storyboarding

We will put markdown documents here to outline the story of the app for different use cases.


## Main Simplified Workflow
The following steps are the beginning to end usage of the app, in simplified form:


1. Landing page for physician (or assistant) to put in demographic and tech info
2. Welcome screen to app for patient
3. Describe what we are going to do (the 3 steps)
4. An html walkthrough of information about
    1. their condition
    1. their option  
    1. other detail
    1. All based on their demographics (i.e. only show info relevant to people in that age bracket, with these test results)
5. The pairwise comparison pages
6. Tell them what the model thinks the best option is, and which health care goal contributed most to that
7. Have prompt for after Physician-Patient discussion for physician to add in the actual patient choice/preference as well as the physician's.
8. Maybe a physician info page at the end that could help the physician understand the patient preference info in detail
