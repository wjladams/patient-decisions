# Slide 2

## Further information on Otosclerosis 

### What is Otosclerosis?
Otosclerosis is a condition that prevents sound vibrations effectively being transmitted from the smallest bone in the body, (Stapes), to the inner ear, causing hearing loss

### Are there any factors that increase my risk of developing otosclerosis?
People are at increased risk of otosclerosis include:
* Individuals who have first degree family member (e.g. parents, siblings) has the condition
* The condition tends to deteriorate during periods of hormonal change like puberty or pregnancy

# Slide 3

## Treatment options
There are two main treatment options for otosclerosis:
1. Hearing aids
2. Surgery

### Hearing aids
Hearing aids increase the the level of sound reaching the ear making it easier to hear the world around you despite otosclerosis

### Surgery
Surgery aims to remove the cause of the reduced hearing by re-modelling the three small bones in the ear

### Notes
* Long term follow-up is not required in most people following treatment. 
* Please discuss this with your ENT doctor to identify which option applies to you
