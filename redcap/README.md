# REDCap resources
Here is where we host the [REDCap](https://www.project-redcap.org/) version of our patient decision application.

* [ThyroidDecisionAid_2020-10-13_1346.REDCap.xml](ThyroidDecisionAid_2020-10-13_1346.REDCap.xml): the Thyroid Cancer application REDCap xml configuration.  
With this file you can recreate our Thyroid Cancer decision application.  The AHP modeling structure is hard coded in this, because of limitations in REDCap.
This will make it difficult to port over to another decision problem, but it is very useful as a template.
